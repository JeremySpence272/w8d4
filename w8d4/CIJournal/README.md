Empty Input Fields: Test how the application handles scenarios where users submit empty fields when creating or updating journal entries. Ensure that appropriate validation messages are displayed and that the application does not crash or produce unexpected behavior.

Long Text Input: Test the application's behavior when users input long text entries, potentially exceeding the character limits or causing formatting issues. Verify that the application can handle and display long entries without performance degradation or display errors.

Special Characters: Check how the application handles special characters in journal entries, such as emojis, non-alphanumeric characters, or HTML tags. Ensure that the application properly sanitizes input to prevent security vulnerabilities like XSS attacks and that it displays special characters correctly.

Date Format: Test scenarios where users input dates in various formats (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY, DD/MM/YYYY, YYYY-MM-DD). Verify that the application correctly parses and displays dates according to the specified format, and that it handles invalid date inputs gracefully.

Concurrency: Simulate scenarios where multiple users attempt to create, update, or delete journal entries simultaneously. Test how the application handles concurrency issues such as race conditions, data inconsistency, or conflicting updates. Implement locking mechanisms or optimistic/pessimistic concurrency control strategies to prevent data corruption.

Permissions and Authorization: Verify that the application enforces proper access controls and permissions, especially in multi-user environments. Test scenarios where unauthorized users attempt to access or modify journal entries, and ensure that the application restricts access and displays appropriate error messages.

Error Handling: Test how the application responds to unexpected errors or exceptions, such as database connection failures, server timeouts, or resource exhaustion. Verify that error messages are informative, user-friendly, and help users understand what went wrong and how to resolve the issue.

Browser Compatibility: Test the application's compatibility with different web browsers and versions, including popular browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. Ensure that the application renders and functions correctly across various browser environments, without layout discrepancies or functionality gaps.
